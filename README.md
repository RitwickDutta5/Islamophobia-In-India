# Islamophobia-In-India
<h2> About the project </h2>

This website is a crucial initiative that aims to document and preserve incidents of violence against Muslims in India, ensuring they are not forgotten or silenced. It is a lifelong commitment to upholding historical records, promoting accountability, and advocating for justice. 

<h2> Inspiration </h2>
By creating a comprehensive resource base, it sheds light on these significant events, counters attempts to suppress marginalized communities, and contributes to the discourse on religious harmony and social justice. Despite challenges to free speech and press freedom, this project stands as a powerful tool in promoting transparency. 

Documentation plays a vital role in shedding light on historical events, enabling a deeper understanding of societal dynamics, and providing a basis for accountability and justice. It serves as a counterforce against attempts to silence marginalized communities and suppress their narratives.

Inspired by the opening of the Partition Museum (https://www.partitionmuseum.org/), i decided to create a github repository of historical data regarding Islamophobia and pogroms in India. 

Here is a screenshot of the webmap for reference:

<h2> Methodology </h2>
Given the recent wave of anti-muslim sentiments in the country under Prime Minister Modi, my color scheme uses the same colors as the one used by his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party - the exact shades of Orange, Green, White and Black. 

The interface has been kept minimalist to make sure that the site is easy to explore, directing users towards relevant information about these large scale pogroms and events that took place. 

I split my code and annoted it to make it easier to follow and replicable.

A brief background is provided along with an article from the Council on Foreign Relations to give relevant context. An accordion was brought in from bootstrap to give the project information hierarchy and allow me to categorise these events chronologically, making it easier to explore. 

Call to actions have been made clear so that the user can be told how to navigate this website and remove any confusions regarding functionality. 

The images have been provided in the sidebar and not the popups as it allows the map to stay relatively unpopulated to draw the attention of the user to the information. Upon clicking the image, the links will open in a new tab to facilitate further reading and keep the user on the webmap throughout, making sure they do not get sidetracked. 

The popups are the easiest way to convey information, and are written in a way that it builds intrigue to the user to explore these issues more, hence the further links are hyperlinked into the images under each button.
